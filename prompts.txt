PROMPTS USED 


1.) i have the below cobol code, 
can you please read the below code and tabulate the performance on the basis of CPU utilization, I/O ops, runtime and similar factors for the impact on system? 

result: 
Factor:	Estimate
CPU Utilization:	Moderate to high
I/O Operations:	High
Runtime	Variable: could range from minutes to hours
Memory Usage:	Low to moderate
Disk Space:	Depends on the size of the input dataset
Error Handling:	None
Resource Management:	Moderate
Impact on System:	Moderate to high


2.) Modify the COBOL program, optimize CPU, I/O, runtime, memory, and disk space, with robust error handling in all paragraphs, 
ensure minimal impact on the mainframe system 
(NOTE: **paste the code again if new chat**)

Result: New code generated with error handlings and all neccesary routines as is, ie.  no functional change observed.
